    <h1>Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>
    
    <p>
        Time complexity is a fundamental concept in computer science that measures the efficiency of an algorithm. It quantifies the amount of time an algorithm takes to run based on the size of the input. An efficient algorithm has low time complexity, which means it can process large inputs quickly and is desirable for many computing tasks.

        Space Complexity is another crucial aspect to consider in algorithm analysis. It relates to the amount of memory an algorithm uses while running. When analyzing space complexity, we often use Big O notation, denoted as O(n), to describe how the space requirements grow with the input size. <b>Space Complexity</b> is especially significant in scenarios with limited memory resources or when optimizing for lower memory consumption.
